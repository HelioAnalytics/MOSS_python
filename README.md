This series of tutorials is part of the Magnetosphere Online Seminar Series (MOSS). Python tutorials occur on the last (non-holiday) Monday of the month at 12pm ET.  

These tutorials are made possible through the support of the NASA GSFC Advanced Software Technology Group.  
See their extensive python course materials here:  https://github.com/astg606/py_courses

To start, you can take the <a href="https://forms.gle/PTV6xFCA21NYkqfp9">Python Assessment Test</a>

A score of 80% or higher means you may want to skip the "beginner" course material.
